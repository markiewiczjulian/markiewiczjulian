### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Julian Markiewicz. I am interested and eager to learn new technologies whether that's the frontend or backend. I am a big linux fan, also enjoy using new technologies to bring an excellent user experience. Being a self motivated learner and hard worker interested in continuous self improvement. I am frequent user of open source software and I would like to try to contribute to community whether by writing articles about software or making changes to excellent tools that need some improvements.
